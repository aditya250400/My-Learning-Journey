# Welcome to My Learning Journey Repository

This repository is structured to track my progress as I learn fullstack development. Each folder represents a specific topic or milestone in my learning path. It serves as my personal documentation as I relearn programming languages and technologies. This includes materials from tutorials, courses, and experiences I've gained, ranging from basic to advanced levels, along with various projects.

Feel free to explore the different sections that document my learning in areas such as frontend and backend development, as well as real-world projects to solidify my understanding.

- **Basic**: Foundational skills such as C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, PHP, and Java. These topics cover the core concepts essential for understanding programming and web development.

- **Intermediate**: Backend development using OOP PHP, Node.js, and frontend frameworks like Bootstrap and TailwindCSS. These skills build on the basics and enable the creation of more complex web applications.

- **Advanced**: Frontend frameworks (React.js and Vue.js) and backend technologies (Express.js and Laravel) for building sophisticated web applications. Includes advanced concepts for state management, routing, and API development.

- **Projects**: Real-world applications designed to solidify learning. This section includes beginner, intermediate, and final projects that demonstrate practical applications of the skills learned.
